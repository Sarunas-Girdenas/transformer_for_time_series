# TST - Transformer Architecture for Time Series Data

This is Transformer for time series classification. Very heavily inspired by [Peter Bloem's](http://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) code and explanations. Idea of adding positional encodings with 1D convolutions is from [Attend and Diagnose](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03905) paper.
